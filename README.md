# UofTHacksIII-VIT

VIT was conceptualized and created by Paul Mullins, with the help of Toby Thomas and Lisa Guo.

A sensory substitution for sight, to be used by the visually impaired. 
This system turns depth information into a haptic vibration array. This array is to be placed on the user's back to create a vibratory landscape of the user's surroundings, where closer objects trigger stronger vibrations.

This system scales 480 by 640 data from a Kinect's depth sensor down and feeds this new data into the haptic feedback array.
